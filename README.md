# ThirdSound

Solves for standing wave solutions of third sound (surface waves) on thin-film helium of liquid depth $h$, in a 1D rectangular box. Hard-wall boundary conditions are assumed on the bottom of the container and the side walls. 

Uses the numerical method developed by A. J. Roberts [IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics, Volume 31, Issue 1, July 1983, Pages 13â€“35,]


The equations for the surface $\eta(x,t)$ and potential $\phi(x,y,t)$ are 

$$ \partial_t \eta + \phi_x \eta_x = \phi_y  $$

$$ \partial_t \phi - \alpha \left[\frac{1}{(h + \eta)^3} - \frac{1}{h^3} \right] + \frac{1}{2}( \phi_x^2 + \phi_y^2) =0  $$

An example solution for the surface profile is shown below, for $h=0.2$. This partciular example is a cnoidal-like wave.
